The objective is to identify notable shifts in production strategies, viewer preferences, and genre-specific patterns. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical summaries to provide actionable insights into how the film industry evolved during these periods. A KDE(Kernel Density Estimate) plot has been employed to plot continuous variables since KDE plots are particularly useful when comparing multiple distributions and provides a smooth curve making it easier to do a comparison between pre-COVID and post-COVID periods. This notebook includes:\n\nRatings Distribution\nRevenue Distribution\nBudget Distribution\nGenre Distribution\nRuntime Distribution\nProduction Countries Distribution\nKeywords Distribution\n\nand comparison of some continuous variables with Genre:\n\nRuntime by Genre\nRatings by Genre\nRevenue by Genre\nBudget by Genre\n\nThis study aims to highlight the implications of these shifts on the industry and inform future strategies.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np"

This suggests that most titles during both periods had runtimes clustered around this range. - Density Variation: The Post-COVID dataset (red) shows a slightly higher peak density compared to the Pre-COVID dataset (green). This could imply a tighter clustering of runtimes during the Post-COVID period. - Longer Runtimes: Both distributions taper off for longer runtimes (&gt;150 minutes), indicating that titles with exceptionally long runtimes were rare in both periods. - Short Runtimes: There is a noticeable difference in the short runtime range (&lt;50 minutes). The Pre-COVID dataset shows more density for shorter titles than the Post-COVID dataset. This could indicate a reduction in shorter runtime titles after COVID. These insights suggest some changes in runtime distribution between the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID periods, with notable differences at the shorter and peak runtime ranges."

This could indicate a shift towards longer storytelling formats in family-oriented genres.\n\nAction and Adventure:\nRuntimes in these genres remain relatively consistent across both periods, suggesting sustained audience expectations for these genres.\n\n\nDocumentaries:\nPost-COVID, there is a wider spread in runtimes for documentaries, indicating a diverse approach to storytelling, potentially driven by increased production of short-form content and feature-length documentaries.\n\n\nDrama and Thriller:\nMinimal changes were observed in runtime distributions, implying stability in audience preferences for these genres."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis reveals distinct shifts in the movie industry’s dynamics across ratings, revenue, and budgets during the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID periods. While some genres demonstrated resilience, others faced challenges reflective of changing audience preferences and production constraints.\n\nResilient Genres:\nFamily-friendly genres like Animation and Family, and low-budget genres like Horror and Music, maintained consistent ratings and appeal. These genres adapted well to pandemic-related shifts, leveraging streaming platforms and low production costs to sustain their performance.\n\n\nChallenges for Big-Budget Genres:\nTraditionally dominant genres such as Action, Adventure, Fantasy, and Science Fiction saw reduced budgets and revenues during the Post-COVID period. This decline likely stems from the logistical challenges and restrictions imposed on large-scale productions during the pandemic, underscoring the vulnerability of high-budget films to external disruptions.\n\n\nAudience Preference Shifts:\nThe Post-COVID period saw increased variability in ratings for genres like Action, Adventure, and Horror, reflecting the evolving tastes of audiences. Escapist genres gained popularity, driven by the demand for visually engaging, immersive entertainment during uncertain times.\n\n\nEconomic Caution:\nMid-budget genres such as Drama, Comedy, and Romance maintained steady revenue and budgets across periods. However, genres like History and Mystery experienced reduced budgets, highlighting cautious investment decisions in less commercially predictable genres.\n\n\nFinal Takeaway:\nThe pandemic has underscored the importance of adaptability in the film industry. While large-scale productions faced setbacks, genres that thrive on modest budgets and family appeal proved to be resilient. Moving forward, balancing blockbuster ambitions with economic prudence and leveraging streaming platforms for diverse genres could help the industry navigate uncertainties and maximize audience engagement.\nOverall, this analysis underscores the resilience of the movie industry in adapting to changing circumstances and audience preferences during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings provide valuable insights for filmmakers, producers, and marketers to tailor strategies for future content creation and distribution."

As someone with a long-standing interest in movies and a curiosity about Netflix’s business strategy, I was particularly intrigued by how the streaming giant adapted its content library in response to the pandemic. This project is an effort to explore the changes in Netflix’s movie catalog by comparing data from the pre-COVID and post-COVID periods.\nTo enrich the analysis, I incorporated data from the TMDB dataset, which provides extensive information about movies, such as genres, popularity, and release years. By connecting Netflix’s pre- and post-COVID datasets with TMDB, I aim to identify patterns, shifts, and trends in Netflix’s content strategy."

Merging Datasets\nAfter cleaning the datasets by standardizing title cases to lowercase and removing duplicates, I merged the cleaned pre-COVID Netflix dataset and post-COVID Netflix dataset with the TMDB dataset. The merge was performed using an inner join on the standardized title column (title_lower). This approach ensures that only Netflix titles present in the TMDB dataset are included in the resulting merged datasets. The TMDB dataset contains additional information about titles, making it valuable for deeper analysis.\n\n# Merge datasets on standardized title\npre_merged_df = pd.merge(pre_netflix_df, tmdb_df, on='title_lower', how='inner')\n\n# Save pre merged dataset\npre_merged_df.to_csv('pre_covid_merged_titles.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(f'Pre-COVID Merged dataset shape: {pre_merged_df.shape}')\n\nPre-COVID Merged dataset shape: (3650, 37)\n\n\nFor the post-COVID Netflix dataset, an additional filter was applied to include only titles with a release year greater than or equal to 2020, ensuring that only relevant post-COVID titles are retained. After filtering, the dataset was merged with the TMDB dataset similarly using an inner join.\n\n# Filter post-COVID titles (release year &gt;= 2020)\npost_merged_df = post_netflix_df[post_netflix_df['release_year'] &gt;= 2020]\npost_merged_df = pd.merge(post_netflix_df, tmdb_df, on='title_lower', how='inner')\n\n# Save post-COVID merged dataset\npost_merged_df.to_csv('post_covid_merged_titles.csv', index=False)\n\nprint(f'Post-COVID merged dataset shape: {post_merged_df.shape}')\n\nPost-COVID merged dataset shape: (3610, 40)\n\n\nFinally, the resulting merged datasets were saved as separate CSV files:\n\npre_covid_merged_titles.csv contains the merged pre-COVID titles.\npost_covid_merged_titles.csv contains the merged post-COVID titles.\n\nThis process highlights the focus on aligning Netflix titles with TMDB data to enhance analysis capabilities. The shapes of the resulting datasets were printed to validate the number of titles retained after merging.\n\n\n4. Statistics and Identifying Common Titles\nNow, I need to isolate titles from each merged dataset for detailed comparisons or trend analysis, such as studying the impact of COVID on Netflix’s content library. Also, this is required so that no duplicates are analyzed when analyzing pre-COVID and post-COVID data seperately.\n\n# Load pre-COVID dataset\nfiltered_df = pd.read_csv('pre_covid_merged_titles.csv')\n\n\n# Load post-COVID dataset\npost_matching_df = pd.read_csv('post_covid_merged_titles.csv')\n\n\n# Find common titles between datasets\ncommon_titles = pd.merge(filtered_df, post_matching_df, on='title_lower', how='inner')\n# Save common and remaining titles\ncommon_titles.to_csv('common_titles.csv', index=False)\nprint(f'Number of common titles: {common_titles.shape[0]}')\n\nNumber of common titles: 1484\n\n\n\n#Filtering out the remaining titles for pre-COVID\npre_covid_remaining = filtered_df[~filtered_df['title_lower'].isin(common_titles['title_lower'])]\npre_covid_remaining.to_csv('pre_covid_remaining.csv', index=False)\nprint(f'Number of pre-COVID titles: {pre_covid_remaining.shape[0]}')\n\nNumber of pre-COVID titles: 2166\n\n\n\n#Filtering out the remaining titles for post-COVID\npost_covid_remaining = post_matching_df[~post_matching_df['title_lower'].isin(common_titles['title_lower'])]\npost_covid_remaining.to_csv('post_covid_remaining.csv', index=False)\nprint(f'Number of post-COVID titles: {post_covid_remaining.shape[0]}')\n\nNumber of post-COVID titles: 2126"

This suggests that most titles during both periods had runtimes clustered around this range. - Density Variation: The Post-COVID dataset (red) shows a slightly higher peak density compared to the Pre-COVID dataset (green). This could imply a tighter clustering of runtimes during the Post-COVID period. - Longer Runtimes: Both distributions taper off for longer runtimes (&gt;150 minutes), indicating that titles with exceptionally long runtimes were rare in both periods. - Short Runtimes: There is a noticeable difference in the short runtime range (&lt;50 minutes). The Pre-COVID dataset shows more density for shorter titles than the Post-COVID dataset. This could indicate a reduction in shorter runtime titles after COVID. These insights suggest some changes in runtime distribution between the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID periods, with notable differences at the shorter and peak runtime ranges."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis reveals distinct shifts in the movie industry’s dynamics across ratings, revenue, and budgets during the Pre-COVID and Post-COVID periods. While some genres demonstrated resilience, others faced challenges reflective of changing audience preferences and production constraints.\n\nResilient Genres:\nFamily-friendly genres like Animation and Family, and low-budget genres like Horror and Music, maintained consistent ratings and appeal. These genres adapted well to pandemic-related shifts, leveraging streaming platforms and low production costs to sustain their performance.\n\n\nChallenges for Big-Budget Genres:\nTraditionally dominant genres such as Action, Adventure, Fantasy, and Science Fiction saw reduced budgets and revenues during the Post-COVID period. This decline likely stems from the logistical challenges and restrictions imposed on large-scale productions during the pandemic, underscoring the vulnerability of high-budget films to external disruptions.\n\n\nAudience Preference Shifts:\nThe Post-COVID period saw increased variability in ratings for genres like Action, Adventure, and Horror, reflecting the evolving tastes of audiences. Escapist genres gained popularity, driven by the demand for visually engaging, immersive entertainment during uncertain times.\n\n\nEconomic Caution:\nMid-budget genres such as Drama, Comedy, and Romance maintained steady revenue and budgets across periods. However, genres like History and Mystery experienced reduced budgets, highlighting cautious investment decisions in less commercially predictable genres.\n\n\nFinal Takeaway:\nThe pandemic has underscored the importance of adaptability in the film industry. While large-scale productions faced setbacks, genres that thrive on modest budgets and family appeal proved to be resilient. Moving forward, balancing blockbuster ambitions with economic prudence and leveraging streaming platforms for diverse genres could help the industry navigate uncertainties and maximize audience engagement.\nOverall, this analysis underscores the resilience of the movie industry in adapting to changing circumstances and audience preferences during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings provide valuable insights for filmmakers, producers, and marketers to tailor strategies for future content creation and distribution."
